						About Me
					</div>
					<div class="sec-body">										
						I am a <h2 class="bold">Master of Computing Student</h2> at <h2 class="bold">School of Computing, National University of Singapore</h2>. I will be graduating in December 2015. I have profound interest in concepts related to <h2 class="bold">Application/System Integration and Automation</h2>. I recently started working on topics related to web such as <h2 class="bold">Web Application development</h2> and <h2 class="bold">Web Security</h2>. I have been working on a few projects to get my hands dirty in this field.<br> 
						I love to work on new technologies and I am always game to try out new things. I employ a very basic approach - <h2 id="quote-prim">"Knowing is not enough, we must apply"</h2>. I am always inclined towards doing hands-on work besides understanding theoretical concepts. <div id="quote-sec">Experimentation is the key!!</div> I love to work in an environment where I can see the impact of my work on user base and interact with user/client. 
						<br/>
						Apart from computer science I love to read and indulge in outdoor sporting activities. I am an above average player of table tennis and pool/snooker (at least I like to think so <img src="http://sidd.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> ).

						Currently I am working as a Software Intern at <a href="http://cms.quantuminventions.com/"><h2 class="bold">Quantum Inventions</h2></a>. I am working on a couple of things at QI -
						<ul>
							<li>Migrating web service calls and data manipulation infrastructure developed on Ruby to another technology, namely <a href="https://www.talend.com/"><h2 class="bold">Talend</h2></a>, which provides an unified platform for data integration across different platforms. This tool is based on <h2 class="bold">Java</h2> </li>
							<li>I am also working on a web application that generates advertisements based on population of a particular area and current time.</li>
						</ul>

						During my semester, before joining QI, I was appointed as <h2 class="bold">Teaching Assistant</h2> for one of the under graduate modules at NUS. This was a Data Structure and Algorithm module (<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1020/1_module_info/desc.html">CS1020E</a>). Following were my responsibilities as a TA:
						
						<ul>
							<li>Organized weekly lab sessions for enrolled students</li>

							<li>Meticulously analyze student's submission as part of graded submission</li>
							<li>Make presentation for solutions of some of the algorithmic prblems given to students</li>
						</ul>

						Before coming to NUS for graduate program, I was working with <h2 class="bold">ZS Associates</h2> as an Technology Associate (2013-14). ZS Associates provided technological solutions in the field of sales and marketing consultancy. Here is a brief description of my work at ZS:  
						<ul>
							<li>Design and develop system for managing organization wide hierarchy and sales force deployed in the field</li>
							<li>Develope <h2 class="bold">ETL </h2>flows to process data and application of business rules</li>
							<li>Automating the system for daily and monthly runs</li>
							<li>System testing, System integration and testing and operationalizing the system</li>
							<li>I was also involved in increasing system's efficiency</li>
							
						</ul>

						Before my 15 months of tenure at ZS Associates, I was employed with Verizon Data Services (India). My work at Verizon mainly involved-
						<ul>
							<li>Developing unified ordering system on <h2 class="bold">Concept Wave</h2>, a tool based on <h2 class="bold">JavaScript</h2></li>
							<li>Organized team wide training sessions and constant feed back</li>
						</ul>

						As written in About Me, I like to travel and read a lot and thus I am a very social person. I love to meet and know new people and hence I volunteered in <h2 class="bold">CommonWealth Games 2010,</h2> held at Delhi. I am also an active volunteer for <h2 class="bold">NUS ICare</h2>, to help international students feel home at NUS. I like to learn about knew things and hence you will find me more on quora rather than on facebook.
						Here are some of the blogs that I write - 
						<ul>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://naman.quora.com">naman.quora.com</a></li>
							<li><a target="_blank" href="http://namanagg.wordpress.com">namanagg.wordpress.com</a></li>
						</ul>
						I would like to write more,especially about my travel experiances and the things I develop.
						<br/>
						I have decided to put all my work online under MIT licence, so everybody can use and build on the code. Here is the link to my GitHub profile - 
						<ul>
