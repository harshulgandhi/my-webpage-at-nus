						About Me
					</div>
					<div class="sec-body">										
						I am a <h2 class="bold">Master of Computing Student</h2> at <h2 class="bold">School of Computing, National University of Singapore</h2>. I will be graduating in December 2015. I have profound interest in concepts related to <h2 class="bold">Application/System Integration and Automation</h2>. I recently started working on topics related to web such as <h2 class="bold">Web Application development</h2> and <h2 class="bold">Web Security</h2>. I have been working on a few projects to get my hands dirty in this field.<br> 
						I love to work on new technologies and I am always game to try out new things. I employ a very basic approach - <h2 id="quote-prim">"Knowing is not enough, we must apply"</h2>. I am always inclined towards doing hands-on work besides understanding theoretical concepts. <div id="quote-sec">Experimentation is the key!!</div> I love to work in an environment where I can see the impact of my work on user base and interact with user/client. 
						<br/>
						Apart from computer science I love to read and indulge in outdoor sporting activities. I am an above average player of table tennis and pool/snooker (at least I like to think so <img src="http://sidd.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> ).

						Currently I am working as a Software Intern at <a href="http://cms.quantuminventions.com/"><h2 class="bold">Quantum Inventions</h2></a>. I am working on a couple of things at QI -
						<ul>
							<li>Migrating web service calls and data manipulation infrastructure developed on Ruby to another technology, namely <a href="https://www.talend.com/"><h2 class="bold">Talend</h2></a>, which provides an unified platform for data integration across different platforms. This tool is based on <h2 class="bold">Java</h2> </li>
							<li>I am also working on a web application that generates advertisements based on population of a particular area and current time.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="sec-body">
						During my semester, before joining QI, I was appointed as <h2 class="bold">Teaching Assistant</h2> for one of the under graduate modules at NUS. This was a Data Structure and Algorithm module (<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1020/1_module_info/desc.html">CS1020E</a>). Following were my responsibilities as a TA:
						
						<ul>
							<li>Organized weekly lab sessions for enrolled students</li>
							<li>Discuss questions from there programming assignments for data structure and algorithms </li>
							<li>Meticulously analyze student's submission as part of graded submission</li>
							<li>Make presentation for solutions of some of the algorithmic prblems given to students</li>
						</ul>

						Before coming to NUS for graduate program, I was working with <h2 class="bold">ZS Associates</h2> as an Technology Associate (2013-14). ZS Associates provided technological solutions in the field of sales and marketing consultancy. Here is a brief description of my work at ZS:  
						<ul>
							<li>Design and develop system for managing organization wide hierarchy and sales force deployed in the field</li>
							<li>Develope <h2 class="bold">ETL </h2>flows to process data and application of business rules</li>
							<li>Automating the system for daily and monthly runs</li>
							<li>System testing, System integration and testing and operationalizing the system</li>
							<li>I was also involved in increasing system's efficiency</li>
							
						</ul>

						Before my 15 months of tenure at ZS Associates, I was employed with Verizon Data Services (India). My work at Verizon mainly involved-
						<ul>
							<li>Developing unified ordering system on <h2 class="bold">Concept Wave</h2>, a tool based on <h2 class="bold">JavaScript</h2></li>
							<li>Organized team wide training sessions and constant feed back</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="sec-body">										
						So far, my coursework at <h2 class="bold">NUS</h2> included - 
						<ul>
							<li>Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</li>
							<li>Robot Motion Planning a control</li>
							<li>Systems Security</li>
							<li>Web Security</li>
							<li>Hands on with Business Analytics</li>
							<li>Simulation and Modelling techniques</li>							
						</ul>						
						I completed my under graduate(B.Tech) from <h2 class="bold">National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India</h2> in 2012. Some of the courses that I took were-
						<br/>
						<ul>
							<li>Relational Database Mangement Systems</li>
							<li>Analysis and Design of Algorithms</li>
							<li>Operating Systems</li>
							<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
							<li>Computer Networks</li>
							<li>Computer Architecture</li>
						</ul>						
						My undergraduate journey was a balanced blend of research projects and events organization. I mainly focused on implementing theoretical knowledge in form of projects. With this frame of mind, I worked on designing and developing <h2 class="bold">algorithms for autonomous robots</h2>. I also worked on <h2 class="bold">Image Processing</h2> using <h2 class="bold">MATLAB</h2>, Serial and Parallel Communication and Embedded Systems.

						I love to interact with new people and indulge in discussions. I also developed interest in teaching during my under graduation days and organised various workshops. I also hosted many events at college and a couple of corporate level events. The biggest event that I organised was a National level robotics competition. I helped me gain a lot qualities like, diligence, managing time and resources,  well before I completed my under graduation. 
						When it comes to reading, I am equally inclined towards fiction and non-fiction. For non-fiction, I generally read new paper articles from The Hindu, especially the ones listed in editorial page. 
						<br/>
						I have put all my work on git hub, most of which is publicaly accessible. Feel free to fork any of the repo and let me know in case you need any extra information about these projects. The link to my GitHub account is
