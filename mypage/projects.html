				Web Security - Cross Site Request Forgery scanner [NUS, 2015]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				This was semester project for Web Security module that I signed up for. As part of this, we developed a scanner that points out all the CSRF injection points in a website. The design of this scanner is modular, with 4 separate stages. First stage crawls all the pages of a website and points out all the plausible injection points, second stage gives all the payloads for each injection point, third stage verifies if a combination of injection point and payload is a valid attack vector and forth stage generates selenium scripts. These selenium scripts show the attack in an automated fashion. Code for the final scanner is available on my github account.

				PlaceR: A place recommendation system [NUS, 2015]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				This was a business analytics project. We though of developing something that would help tourists visiting a new place. We designed and developed a place recommendation system. Recommendation is based on user's interest devised from his twitter account. To do this, we fetch their tweets and apply some NLP and text processing techniques like tokenization, key word identification etc. This system is developed as separate modules and can be plugged into other social sensors for precise interest gathering. For this project, we only used twitter.

			<div class="proj-body">
				I am working on design and development of a <a href="http://www.bhavnagandhi.com/">website</a> for a professional doctor. Currently the 
				website is in its initial phase with a minimalistic release. More pages to allow consulting patients to interact with the <a href="http://www.bhavnagandhi.com/">website</a> are to be added. This website is developed using a Content Management System.

				OwnCloud - Added shared comment feature [NUS, 2015]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				Implemented several features in OwnCloud application (a web platform for sharing files). One feature was a tour of the application that would guide new users on how to upload and edit documents. Another feature as - a user could invite another user to comment on a particular file. Then both users could simultaneously comment on the file and see each other's comment. Also, a list of online users was populated on the interface.

				Computer Vision: 3D reconstruction of a scene from single 2D image [NUS, 2014]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				Developed and implemented an algorithm to construct 3D view of a 2D image of a scene. A very famous concept from the field of computer vision - perspective and orthographic projection model - was used. Also developed a GUI using PyQt to input an image and provide initial data for processing. A background script written in Python constructed different frames showing 3D view of the input image. These frames were then combined to form a video.

				Android: Incog Private Information Protection - IP2 [NUS, 2014]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				Studied Android system and what are the current vulnerabilities it is. To tackle those vulnerabilities we developed an application that allows users to run a particular application in Incognito mode. This mode is something similar to browser incognito mode only with added features. This provides protection to the application against attacks.

				Digital Clock [NIT Bhopal, 2010]
			</div>
			<div class="proj-body">
				This is a project i developed during  sem break of 2nd year of my under graduation. I wanted to learn more about microcontroller and how we can program them to develop specific products. I started thinking of replicating something that we use very often. Thats when developing a digital clock came into my mind. I had also done some work on interfacing a 16x2 LCD display with microcontroller so i was sure that I would use that as a display interface. Next I developed and implemented an algorithm for the clock. I wrote this code in C and programmed microcontroller with it.
